*Dynamic Content Filtering – Short Note (Point Wise)

*Create a list of items (like products or movies) and show them on the webpage using HTML.

*Add a search input box where the user can type text.

*Use JavaScript to listen for user typing (keyup event).

*Use array methods like filter() and includes() to match items with the search text.

*Update the displayed list instantly as the user types (real-time filtering).
